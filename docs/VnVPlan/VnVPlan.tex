\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

This Verification and Validation Plan describes the testing process for ScoreGen, an 
audio-to-sheet music generator, such that the following core functionalities perform as desired:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Signal processing of audio input
  \item Identification of pitch, rhythm, and timing
  \item Generation of readable and accurate sheet music
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Objectives}

\subsubsection{Desired System Qualities}

The primary objective of this document is to ensure that the audio-to-sheet music system produces 
highly accurate, reliable, and usable output, successfully meeting the needs of all stakeholders. 
Key qualities this VnV will aim to accomplish include the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Demonstrate accuracy in music notation
  \item Ease of use amongst users with varying characteristics
  \item Readable, easy to understand outputs
  \item An enjoyable user experience
  \item Efficiency and Responsiveness
  \item Portability of the software
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Out of Scope Objectives}
In order to meet time and cost requirements, the following objectives will be out of the scope of 
this VnV plan:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Advanced polyphonic and multi-instrumental audio:
  
  Monophonic audio is easily processed using signal analysis, but introducing a multitude of 
  simultaneous signals will require advanced algorithms to separate each note.
  
  \item Cross-platform support:
  
  Majority of the team members will be writing the system’s software on their personal Windows PC. 
  Testing should thus occur in the same environment it is being developed in in order to reduce 
  performance variability of the final system.
  
  \item Advanced music notation, such as dynamics and accents:
  
  Dynamics and accents can be tricky to differentiate, and attempting to identify them is likely to 
  introduce a level of error to the output that is undesired. As well, a beginner musician may feel 
  overwhelmed being faced with a large variety of notation that they don’t recognize.
  
  \item Support for non-Western music notation:
  
  This software will exclusively produce sheet music according to Western music conventions. Expanding 
  to alternative notation conventions would require significant adapting of the output format, and is 
  infeasible given the current scope of the project. 
  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

\subsubsection{Challenge Level}

The ScoreGen project is categorized in the general challenge level, meaning it is not particularly novel 
and requires a senior highschool level or junior undergraduate level of domain knowledge/implementation. 
Projects in this category are required to include ‘extras’ in order to meet the difficulty level expected 
of a final-year capstone course.

\subsubsection{Project Extras}
\begin{itemize}
  \item User manual
  \item Usability testing
  \item GenderMag personas
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

This document is just one of many written to provide a comprehensive overview of the project and its desired 
outcomes. The other project documents include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/emilyperica/ScoreGen/blob/main/docs/DevelopmentPlan/DevelopmentPlan.pdf}{Development Plan} \citep*{ScoreGenDP}: 
  This document acts as a blueprint for the software’s creation as well as the overall structuring of the project itself. Leveraging the information 
  outlined in this document will ensure all verification and validation activities are relevant and within the scope of the project.
  \item \href{https://github.com/emilyperica/ScoreGen/blob/main/docs/ProblemStatementAndGoals/ProblemStatement.pdf}{Problem Statement and Goals} \citep*{ScoreGenPS}:

  \item \href{https://github.com/emilyperica/ScoreGen/blob/main/docs/UserGuide/UserGuide.pdf}{User Guide} \citep*{ScoreGenUG}:
  This guide is intended to be used directly by the end-user to inform them on usage of the software. The VnV aims to 
  verify all use cases and user interactions, and can thus be used to identify the necessary features or steps whose inclusion 
  in the User Guide is critical.
  \item \href{https://github.com/emilyperica/ScoreGen/blob/main/docs/Design/SoftDetailedDes/MIS.pdf}{Module Interface Specification (MIS)} \citep*{ScoreGenMIS}:
  This document defines how different software modules within the system interact with one another, making note of all inputs and outputs. These inputs 
  and outputs will require verification outlined in the VnV Plan to ensure feasibility and accurate constraints are put into place.
  \item \href{https://github.com/emilyperica/ScoreGen/blob/main/docs/Design/SoftArchitecture/MG.pdf}{Module Guide (MG)} \citep*{ScoreGenMG}:
  Where the MIS defines module interactions, this document defines the modules themselves. The VnV tests should target all modules in 
  the system - since the MG will be written after the VnV Plan, it may be necessary to revisit this plan and add/remove tests where necessary 
  as the modules are formalized.
\end{itemize}


\section{Plan}

This section will provide formal validation and verification plans for various aspects of the project. 
Starting with a definition of all individuals involved in the VnV process, it goes on to inform the 
reader of VnV plans for the SRS, design, VnV plan itself, implementation, automated tests, and the 
system software.

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}
\label{sec:srs_verification}

To verify the SRS for our sheet music generation project, we plan to use a combination of informal feedback and structured reviews to ensure accuracy and alignment with the project's goals. The approaches are as follows:

\subsection*{Ad Hoc Feedback from Peers}
We will request informal reviews from our primary reviewers (team 8). Their feedback will help identify potential ambiguities or areas needing clarification. We will ask them to focus on the clarity and feasibility of requirements, ensuring alignment with the intended functionality of the app.

\subsection*{Supervisor Review Meeting}

\textbf{Structured Review Meeting}: We plan to conduct a concise, structured meeting with our project supervisor to leverage their expertise effectively while respecting their time constraints. This meeting will include the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Overview Presentation}: We will present a high-level overview of our initial requirements, focusing on the key features and functionalities we believe are essential for the project. The purpose of this presentation is to quickly bring the supervisor up to speed on the project's direction.
    
    \item \textbf{Discussion on Feasibility and Priority}: We will ask the supervisor to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed requirements, help identify any that are overly ambitious or unrealistic, and highlight those that are core to the project’s success. This will help us prioritize our work based on expert advice.
    
    \item \textbf{Focused Questions}: To guide the discussion and make the best use of the supervisor’s time, we will prepare targeted questions that focus on critical project areas. Examples include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Which requirements are technically challenging or might present significant roadblocks?
        \item Are there any high-priority requirements that we might have overlooked?
        \item Which elements align closely with the project’s objectives, and which might be deferred?
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Utilizing Issue Tracker}: To maintain transparency and track action items, we will record the supervisor’s feedback and any new insights or tasks identified during the meeting in our issue tracker. This will enable us to follow up efficiently and ensure that the supervisor's input is incorporated into subsequent iterations of our requirements document.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Issue Tracking System}
We will use the git issue tracker to log any concerns, suggestions, or changes requested by reviewers. This system will help maintain a clear record of all feedback and revisions made to the SRS, ensuring transparency and accountability in addressing reviewer comments.

This combination of peer and supervisor reviews, structured meetings, and issue tracking should provide comprehensive coverage for SRS verification.

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

To ensure the design of the sheet music generation app meets all functional and non-functional requirements, the following verification plan will be implemented:

\subsubsection*{Peer Review and Feedback}
The design will undergo reviews by our classmates, focusing on key design elements such as the user interface and algorithm selection for audio-to-sheet music conversion. Feedback from peers will help identify usability issues, potential improvements, and ensure that the design aligns with the project goals.

\subsubsection*{Checklist-Based Review}
A checklist will be created to guide reviewers in assessing each design aspect. The checklist will include items such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Are the core algorithms well-suited for the required audio-to-sheet music conversion?
    \item Are system constraints (e.g., processing time, memory usage) addressed in the design?
    \item Is the design modular and maintainable?
\end{itemize}
This checklist will help standardize feedback, ensuring a thorough and consistent review process.

\subsubsection*{Supervisor Review}
In addition to peer review, we will present the design to our project supervisor for further validation. The supervisor will be provided with the design documents and checklist before the review session to facilitate a structured examination of each design component. Key discussion points will include scalability, performance optimization, and potential risks. 

\subsubsection*{Issue Tracking and Follow-Up}
Git Issues will be used to log any design issues or recommendations identified during the review process. This will provide a centralized record of all feedback and allow for systematic tracking of design revisions, ensuring that each suggestion is addressed or appropriately documented.

This design verification plan, incorporating both peer and supervisor feedback along with checklist-guided reviews and structured follow-up, will ensure the design is robust, user-friendly, and aligned with project requirements.


\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

\textbf{Verification and Validation Plan Checklist}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Plan Review by Peers}: Ensure the verification and validation plan is reviewed by classmates to gain diverse insights and identify potential improvements.
    \item \textbf{Requirement Coverage}: Verify that all requirements are adequately covered by the verification and validation plan, ensuring no critical areas are omitted.
    \item \textbf{Traceability}: Confirm traceability of each verification and validation activity to specific project requirements to maintain alignment with project goals.
    \item \textbf{Clarity and Completeness}: Review the plan for clarity, making sure all instructions and testing procedures are clear and complete for future reference.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}


The Implementation Verification Plan outlines the strategies and methodologies we will employ to verify the correctness and quality of our implementation.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unit Testing Plan}: A comprehensive unit testing plan will be developed, which includes a detailed list of tests designed to verify the functionality of individual components of the system. Each unit test will target specific functions or classes to ensure they perform as expected under various conditions. The results of these tests will be crucial for identifying and resolving issues early in the development process.

    \item \textbf{Static Verification Methods}: In addition to dynamic testing, we will implement several static verification techniques to enhance the quality of our code. These methods allow us to analyze the code without executing it, thereby identifying potential issues at an early stage. The techniques we plan to use include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Code Walkthroughs}: We will conduct peer reviews in the form of code walkthroughs, where team members will systematically review code segments. This collaborative approach encourages knowledge sharing and helps catch defects or design flaws that may not be evident to the original developer.
        \item \textbf{Static Analyzers}: We will employ static analysis tools to automatically analyze the code for common programming errors, potential security vulnerabilities, and adherence to coding best practices. These tools provide insights that can help us improve code quality and reduce technical debt.
    \end{itemize}

    By integrating both unit testing and static verification methods into our implementation verification plan, we aim to ensure that our code is robust, maintainable, and free from critical defects. This dual approach not only enhances the reliability of our implementation but also streamlines the development process by identifying issues early on, reducing the risk of more significant problems later in the project lifecycle.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

For our project, we plan to utilize GitHub Actions to create a continuous integration pipeline, which will automate the build and testing processes. We will employ the Google Test framework for unit testing, as it provides a robust and easy-to-use interface for writing and executing C++ test cases.

In addition to unit testing, we will implement linters to verify coding standards and maintain consistency across the codebase. The coding standards we will follow include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html}{Google's C++ Style Guide} \citep*{GoogleCppStyleGuide} for C++.
    \item \href{https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/}{PEP8 Style Guide} \citep*{PEP8PythonStyleGuide}: for Python.
    \item \href{https://getbem.com/}{BEM Methodology} \citep*{BEMMethodology}: for HTML and CSS.
\end{itemize}

We will summarize code coverage metrics by integrating a coverage tool like gcov with our CI pipeline, allowing us to visualize the effectiveness of our tests and identify untested code paths.

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

For our project, we plan to validate the functionality of our application using imported music files. These music files will serve as test cases to ensure that our software correctly processes and generates sheet music from audio inputs.

To further validate the product we will conduct user testing to gather feedback on the functionality and usability of our application, allowing us to make improvements based on user experiences.

There will also be a quality assurance testing effort to ensure a robust adherence to the defined SRS requirements, as further defined in the \hyperref[sec:srs_verification]{SRS Verification Plan}

\section{System Tests}

System tests are categorized into two subsections. Section 4.1 lists test cases for functional requirements defined in 
the SRS. Section 4.2 lists test cases for nonfunctional requirements defined in the SRS. 

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}
Tests for the functional requirements of the application naturally follow the division of the major types of functional requirements
in the SRS (see SRS section 9). Thus, tests for each major type are grouped similarly, resulting in five subcategories.

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
be involved? Be specific.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}

\subsection{Ommitted Testing}
While the majority of the functional requirements have associated test cases, 
some were omitted for various reasons. This section explains their omission from the document. 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item FR-SP4 Processing Limitations \\
  Appears under SRS section 9.2 Signal Processing. \\
  This functional requirement does not
  have a corresponding test case. The nature of this functional requirement demands more technical knowledge
  about implementation details that have not yet been decided. The exact definition of 'overly complex audio input' shall
  remain ambiguous at this stage to prevent the overextension (or underextension) of the development team's
  capabilities during the project's irregular time constraints.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Testing Data and Files}
Requirement test cases may have input that overlap with other test cases, as such, the testing data and files have not specifically been
assigned to any one test case. Testing data is available for any test case that may require them. \\
Test files and datasets are available under the \href{https://github.com/emilyperica/ScoreGen/tree/9203b49bd6b54247517192c6b1992f5fa952478f/test}{test} folder

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?
  
  \textbf{Mark} This deliverable went very well. I feel that our group was able to work separately on 
  different sections of the document, yet when the changes were merged together, the results fit well 
  together. This suggests we operate together smoothly without need of excessive feedback.

  \textbf{Ian}

  \textbf{Emily} Communication within the team for this deliverable was the best it has been to date. 
  It had been lacking during our last deliverable, which led to a less cohesive document and team-wide
  project issues not being fully adressed. This was a good wake-up call for us, and as a result we set
  explicit roles for all aspects of this deliverable, removing the concept of 'group' issues to make 
  sure we don't get stuck in the cycle of assuming someone else is getting things done.

  \textbf{Jackson} I think the best part of this deliverable was how clear the requirements were. I feel as 
  though as a group we are getting used to what we need to deliver to achieve success in each milestone, and in 
  this document in particular I found that we were easily able to divide up the work and complete it efficiently. 
  Additionally, trying to get the main content done a day before the submission deadline helped us to have a buffer 
  of time to fix things up.
  
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?

  \textbf{Mark} There were no particular pain points in this deliverable, though there was significant 
  volume of writing out each section, and there had to be significant recall of previous documents to 
  reference them where necessary.

  \textbf{Ian}

  \textbf{Emily} My biggest pain point was getting over the concept of writing a verification and 
  validation plan before writing any code. I find it difficult to conceptualize abstract tests that are 
  not implementation-specific, so this document was good practice in creating system-wide tests, as 
  opposed to the unit tests I'm more comfortable with writing.

  \textbf{Jackson} The biggest pain point in my opinion was the high coupling between the NFR and FR sections. 
  This caused me to have to wait on creating some sections for the non-functional requirements because the performance 
  requirements specifically were very similar to the functional requirements. Additionally, we had to make sure there were 
  no merge conflicts when adding the mapping chart between test IDs and requirements.

  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, Valgrind etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member. 

  \vspace{5pt}
  Proper verification and validation of this project will require the team to gain both technical 
  and procedural knowledge on performing effectives tests. Gaining proficiency in testing frameworks 
  such as Google Test will allow the team to design and execute a comprehensive test suite, as 
  frameworks will become the base of our unit and integration tests, as well as in our implementation 
  of a regression test suite. The team will need to become comfortable with YAML syntax, as well as 
  its uses in configuration management, to ensure we use GitHub Actions for automated testing to the 
  fullest of its ability. Usage of YAMLs in testing can greatly improve modularity and will make the 
  process of changing test data very easy, if this is ever necessary. Static testing knowledge is a 
  vital aspect of VnV, and all team members will aim to increase their static testing capabilities, 
  focusing on code walkthroughs, inspections, and manual code reviews. Creating a VnV plan is useless 
  without thorough documentation for the VnV report, and thus a vital skill to this aspect of the project 
  is being able to write thorough documentation and taking detailed notes at every step of the process.

  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice? 

  \vspace{5pt}
  \textbf{Proficiency in testing frameworks}

  APPROACH 1: Apply a framework such as Google Test to some example project, and practice creating unit, integration, and system tests. \\
  APPROACH 2: Enroll in and complete an online course covering the usage of a specific test framework.
  
  \textbf{Mark}

  \textbf{Emily} I often prefer learning by doing, rather than reading from a textbook, so I will pursue approach 1.

  \textbf{Ian}

  \textbf{Jackson} Likely approach 1, I’d rather be hands-on.

  \vspace{10pt}
  \textbf{YAML Syntax}

  APPROACH 1: Practice writing YAML syntax by creating GHA workflows. \\
  APPROACH 2: Review YAML files of public projects, such as those from previous years of the capstone course or large open-source projects found on GitHub.
  
  \textbf{Mark}

  \textbf{Emily} Approach 1 is more hands-on and thus applies more to my learning style than approach 2, so this will be my preferred way of gaining YAML knowledge.

  \textbf{Ian}

  \textbf{Jackson} Approach 2 is more attractive to me, I do like reading reference material if I know it's correct.

  \vspace{10pt}
  \textbf{Static testing knowledge}

  APPROACH 1: Identify various tools used for static testing (ex. SonarQube, ESLint) and incorporate them in existing or example projects to get comfortable with their usage. \\
  APPROACH 2: Research and go over existing literature outlining static testing methodologies and best practices.

  \textbf{Mark}

  \textbf{Emily} I will pursue approach 1, as this method is very similar to how we will use static testing within our project and can help me to get comfortable with static testing tools in a relevant environment.

  \textbf{Ian}

  \textbf{Jackson} Approach 1 is better in the case of our project, and I'd rather do that than go through all that documentation about 'best practices'.

  \vspace{10pt}
  \textbf{Documentation}

  APPROACH 1: Write up a variety of reports in different styles using dummy test results. \\
  APPROACH 2: Review course notes from SFWRENG 3RA3 as well as all standards described in Dr. Smith’s lectures.

  \textbf{Mark}

  \textbf{Emily} I will pursue approach 2, as the ease with which I can access the necessary knowledge sources will make it simple for me to learn proper documentation guidelines.

  \textbf{Ian}

  \textbf{Jackson} Since I already took 3RA3, I believe I'd rather review my course notes as a starting point.

\end{enumerate}
