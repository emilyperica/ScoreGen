\section{Introduction}
Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing
software.  A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming
team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}.  We advocate a decomposition
based on the principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}.  This
principle supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module
hides represent likely future changes.  Design for change is valuable in SC,
where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the
solution space is explored.  

Our design follows the rules layed out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is implemented in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG
specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both
designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.  The
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the
  relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to
  check for consistency, feasibility, and flexibility. Designers can verify the
  system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section
\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software
requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that
was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the
modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section
\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules. Section \ref{SecUI} illustrates the design 
of the user interface through drawings, sketches, and design tool prototyping 
(e.g. Figma, Marvel, etc.). Finally, section \ref{SecTL} outlines the schedule 
of tasks related to the development of ScoreGen as well as the development team 
members responsible for these tasks.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden
inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only
require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach
adapted here adheres to the development principle called design for change.

\begin{description}
  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acHardware}:] The specific hardware on which the software is running.
  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acExtractionMapping}:] Musical element extraction and mapping techniques.
  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acMonophonic}:] Monophonic audio processing algorithm(s).
  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acComplex}:] Complex audio processing algorithm(s).
  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acPerformance}:] Performance and latency benchmarks and targets.
\end{description}

\noindent Anticipated changes AC3 and AC4 refer to mathematical framework changes that impact core signal processing functionality. 
Two main methodologies are considered for pitch detection: autocorrelation-based and Fourier-based techniques. For the full 
mathematical specifications of these methodologies, please refer to \nameref{sec:appA}.
  
\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design aims to be as general as possible. If some design decisions
should need to be changed later, then many parts of the design
will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.

\begin{description}
  \item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucInputFormat}:] File format of input data.
  \item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucOutputFormat}:] File format of output audio data.
  \item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucEditing}:] Post-generation editing and progress saving.
  \item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucNotation}:] Choice of sheet music notation.
  \item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucUI}:] User interface features, requirements, usability, styling, etc.
  \item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{nfrStability}:] Non-functional requirements are unlikely to change.
\end{description}

\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

This section provides an overview of the module design. Modules are summarized
in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets in Table \ref{TblMH}. The modules listed
below, which are leaves in the hierarchy tree, are the modules that will
be implemented.

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in
the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection
between requirements and modules is listed in Table~\ref{TblRT}.

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citep{ParnasEtAl1984} . The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the
module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do
without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the
entry is \emph{OS}, this means that the module is provided by the operating
system or by standard programming language libraries. \emph{\progname{}} means the
module will be implemented by the \progname{} software.
Only the leaf modules in the hierarchy will be implemented. If a dash
(\emph{--}) is shown, this means that the module is not a leaf and will not have
to be implemented.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is
provided. \citet{Parnas1978} said of two programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if
correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete the task described in
its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which
the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct
implementation of B.  Figure \ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between
the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the
system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler
because they use modules from the lower levels.

\section*{Appendix A --- Formal Math Specifications} \label{sec:appA}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Appendix A --- Formal Math Specifications}

This appendix provides detailed mathematical formulations for two pitch detection 
methodologies that may be employed for this project's signal processing: autocorrelation-based and Fourier-based techniques. These specifications are general
and intended to be used as a simplified overview of the algorithms. The actual implementation may vary based on emprical performance.
\subsection*{A.1 Autocorrelation-based Pitch Detection}
\textbf{Description:} The autocorrelation method is a time-domain approach that analyzes the periodicity of a signal to determine 
its fundamental frequency. It does so by computing the correlation between the signal and time-shifted versions of itself over a 
range of lags. The lag corresponding to the highest normalized correlation is identified as the pitch period, from which the 
fundamental frequency is derived.\\
The formulation below is based on the autocorrelation technique for pitch detection as detailed in \cite{Rabiner-use} and further discussed in \cite{Rabiner-digital}.\\
\newline
\textbf{Mathematical Formulation:}  
Let \( x[n] \) be a discrete-time signal defined for \( n = 0, 1, \dots, N-1\). The total energy of the signal is computed as:
\[r_0 = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n]^2\]
For a given lag \( \ell \), the autocorrelation function is defined as:
\[r(\ell) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-\ell-1} x[n]\,x[n+\ell]\]
The normalized autocorrelation is then given by:
\[R(\ell) = \frac{r(\ell)}{r_0}\]
The algorithm searches for the lag \( \ell^* \) within a predefined range \([\ell_{\min}, \ell_{\max}]\) that maximizes \( R(\ell) \):
\[\ell^* = \operatorname*{arg\,max}_{\ell \in [\ell_{\min}, \ell_{\max}]} R(\ell)\]
If the maximum normalized autocorrelation \( R(\ell^*) \) exceeds a threshold (e.g., 0.5), the fundamental frequency \( f_0 \) is estimated by:
\[f_0 = \frac{f_s}{\ell^*}\]
where \( f_s \) is the sampling rate. If \( R(\ell^*) < 0.5 \), no clear pitch is detected (i.e., \( f_0 = 0 \)).\\
\newline
\textbf{Parameter Constraints:}  
The search range for \(\ell\) is derived from the desired frequency bounds:
\[\ell_{\max} = \min\left( N-1,\; \left\lfloor \frac{f_s}{f_{\min}} \right\rfloor \right), \quad
\ell_{\min} = \max\left( 1,\; \left\lfloor \frac{f_s}{f_{\max}} \right\rfloor \right)\]
with typical values \( f_{\min} = 100\,\text{Hz} \) and \( f_{\max} = 2000\,\text{Hz} \).\\
\newline
\textbf{Relevant Details:}  
To reduce computational load, the lag \( \ell \) may be incremented in steps (e.g., by 2 samples). The procedure returns the fundamental frequency \( f_0 \) if a valid peak is found; otherwise, it indicates the absence of a clear pitch by returning 0.

\subsection*{A.2 Fourier-based Pitch Detection}
\textbf{Description:} The Fourier-based method analyzes the frequency content of a signal using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
It computes the frequency spectrum of the signal, identifying the peak frequency as the pitch.\\
\newline
\textbf{Mathematical Formulation:} The following describes the three major mathematical components that are considered for this project's signal processing framework:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{The Input Signal:}  
  Let \( x: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R} \) be a discrete-time signal with finite energy:
  \[E = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} |x[n]|^2 < \infty\]
  This formalizes the representation of our raw audio data.

  \item \textit{The Window Function:}  
  To localize the Fourier analysis to specific segments and reduce spectral leakage, a window function is applied \cite{windows-harmonic-analysis}. For a window length \( N \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \) (with \( N \geq 1 \)), we define the Hanning window \( w: \{0, 1, \dots, N-1\} \to \mathbb{R} \) as:
  \[
  w(n) = 
  \begin{cases}
  0.5 - 0.5\cos\left(\frac{2\pi n}{N-1}\right), & 0 \leq n \leq N-1, \\
  0, & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  \]

  \item \textit{The Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT):}  
  The STFT converts segments of the time-domain signal into the frequency domain, enabling the analysis of evolving spectral content \cite{onset-detection, ZhouRiess}. Given a hop size \( H \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \), each frame of the signal is defined as:
  \[\{ x[mH+n] : n = 0, 1, \dots, N-1 \}\]
  where \( m \in \mathbb{Z} \) is the frame index. The Fourier transform of the windowed frame is computed by:
  \[X(m,k) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[mH+n]\,w(n)\, e^{-j\frac{2\pi}{N}kn}\]
  with \( k \in \{0, 1, \dots, N-1\} \) representing the frequency bin index.
\end{enumerate}
