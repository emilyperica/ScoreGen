\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
Music theory is challenging and intimidating to learn for beginners, 
however, the act of playing an instrument does not inherently require 
extensive theoretical knowledge. This project aims to bridge the gap 
between deep theoretical understanding and playing instruments. It 
shall aid musicians with limited music theory knowledge by translating 
analog instrument audio into sheet music and other applicable formats 
that users can use to visualize and document their music-making. The 
project also aims to foster ease of collaboration between musical 
artists for efficient communication. 
\subsection{Goals of the Project}
The goal of the project is to develop a fast, accurate sheet music generator 
paired with an intuitive, user-friendly interface that requires minimal effort 
to learn. If successful, it will encourage the proliferation of musical creativity 
among various audiences. This goal lends itself to several metrics, such as 
computational performance compared to existing products or its reach to certain 
demographics. Ultimately, the benefit of the project will be measured by the number 
of original pieces created.
\section{Stakeholders}
\subsection{Client}
The client is the faculty supervisor of this project, Dr. Martin Von Mohrenschildt. With direct research interests in signal processing and a personal interest in how it relates to 
music, he is investing his own time in the development of the product.
\subsection{Customer}
The archetypal customer is a musician of any skill level, with emphasis based on musicians who have little-to-no music theory knowledge. The customer will utilize the application

\subsection{Personas}
Harold Style is a software engineering student at McMaster University with a deep interest in music, and loves playing the guitar. Despite his lack of a formal music education, 
he has perfect pitch and thus learns songs by listening to them rather than learn how to read sheet music. However, he recently joined a local rock band called The Beetles who 
expect him to contribute during their songwriting sessions. He needs a quick way to produce sheet music for his own compositions, as well as learn to read the scores written by 
his bandmates. As a future software engineer he enjoys learning new technologies that can make his life easier, and he dislikes reading of any sort.
\subsection{Priorities Assigned to Users}
\textbf{Key users:} Beginner musicians
\textbf{Secondary users:} Composers.
\subsection{User Participation}
Beginner musicians will have a high level of participation in the creation of system requirements. Their feedback will be especially essential during the early to middle development phases to ensure that the system meets their various needs for simplicity, intuitive design/usage, and music theory assistance.
Composers will have a moderate level of participation in the creation of system requiremens, slightly less than that of the Beginner Musician group. Their subject matter expertise will be useful in creating relevant requirements to ensure precision of audio transcription and its overall score editing capabilities.
\subsection{Maintenance Users and Service Technicians}
This product will be maintained by a software development team, consisting of software developers, UI/UX designers, test engineers, and a project manager. 
Users will receive product support directly from the customer support team, and IP lawyers will be engaged as necessary to address matters of intellectual property.

\section{Mandated Constraints}
\subsection{Solution Constraints}
\subsubsection*{Technology Stack}
\textbf{Description}: The app shall be developed using a fast for the core signal processing to handle real-time calculations and a robust, secure, and easy-to-configure language for backend logic.\\
\textbf{Rationale}: Signal processing needs to be done quickly and effieciently to be done in real time, and the backend must be secure while handling user information.\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion}: The final product shall process signals quickly and all sensitive user information is secured and nothing gets exposed.
\subsubsection*{Open-Source Libraries}
\textbf{Description}: The app shall use open-source libraries and frameworks where applicable to save both time and money.\\
\textbf{Rationale}: The use of open-source libraries ensures cost-effectiveness and allows for community-driven improvements and support.\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion}: All third-party libraries used in the project must be licensed under open-source agreements such as MIT, GPL, or Apache licenses which allow for free use.

\subsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}
\subsubsection*{Hardware Specifications}
\textbf{Description}: The app shall run on personal computers with a minimum of 8GB RAM, a dual-core processor, and 256GB of available storage space, which is the minimum according to general concensus~\cite{music-specs}.\\
\textbf{Rationale}: These hardware specifications are typical of the devices used by musicians and producers, ensuring the app performs efficiently.\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion}: The app must pass performance tests on machines meeting the minimum hardware requirements, with no more than a 5\% reduction in performance under heavy load.
\subsubsection*{Audio Input Devices}
\textbf{Description}: The app shall support standard audio input devices, including USB microphones, and built-in microphones, with audio input via USB, or 3.5mm audio jacks.\\
\textbf{Rationale}: These input devices are commonly used by musicians to capture sound, ensuring the app is compatible with existing hardware setups.\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion}: The app must successfully capture and process audio from these devices, maintaining accurate signal-to-sheet transcription in at least 95\% of test cases.

\subsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}
\subsubsection*{Music Notation Software}
\textbf{Description}: The app shall collaborate with music notation software that uses MusicXML formats to export sheet music. These can be seen as ‘partner’ applications since they fit very well with a use case for the application.\\
\textbf{Rationale}: Many composers rely on professional notation software to finalize and edit their sheet music, so it’s essential that the app exports accurate, compatible sheet music files.\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion}: The app must support MusicXML files, for version support see section 3.4: Off-the-Shelf Software - Backward Compatability.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
\subsubsection*{MusicXML Format for Sheet Music}
\textbf{Description}: The app shall use MusicXML as the primary format for storing and exporting sheet music data.\\
\textbf{Rationale}: MusicXML is the industry-standard format for sheet music interchange between different music notation software, ensuring compatibility with tools like Sibelius, Finale, MuseScore, and other DAWs. Its widespread adoption makes it the best choice for interoperability.\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion}: The app must successfully export sheet music in MusicXML format, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions of major music notation software, without requiring manual adjustments by the user.
\subsubsection*{Backward Compatibility}
\textbf{Description}: The app shall support both current and older versions of the MusicXML format to ensure maximum compatibility with various notation tools.\\
\textbf{Rationale}: As different users may be using different versions of music notation software, supporting older MusicXML formats ensures accessibility and broader usability.\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion}: The app must successfully import and export MusicXML files using both the latest version of MusicXML and at least one earlier version (e.g., MusicXML 2.0).

\subsection{Anticipated Workplace Environment}
\subsubsection*{Indoor and Studio-Based Environments}
\textbf{Description}: The app shall be designed primarily for indoor environments, such as home studios, professional recording studios, classrooms, and offices where musicians and composers typically work.\\
\textbf{Rationale}: Most users will be working in controlled indoor environments where factors like lighting and noise levels will vary. The app must function optimally in these settings without relying on environmental conditions.\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion}: The app must be tested in various indoor settings (studios, offices, classrooms) with different lighting and noise levels to ensure usability and performance are not impacted by normal environmental variations.
\subsubsection*{Noise Considerations}
\textbf{Description}: The app shall operate effectively in environments with moderate background noise, such as music rehearsal rooms or live performance spaces, without relying on audible notifications.\\
\textbf{Rationale}: Musicians often work in noisy environments. The app should rely on visual feedback rather than any sound-based notifications and should retain its signal-processing ability (see requirement OE-EP1).\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion}: The app must be tested in environments with background noise levels approaching a signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 2:1, indicating its effectiveness with moderate background noise.
\subsubsection*{Portable Workspaces}
\textbf{Description}: The app shall be designed to accommodate musicians working in mobile or temporary workspaces, such as cafes or on-the-go setups using laptops.\\
\textbf{Rationale}: Musicians often work on the move or in shared spaces where setting up large equipment is impractical. The app must be optimized for laptops with limited screen space and varying internet connectivity.\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion}: The app must be tested for usability on laptops with screen sizes as small as 13 inches.

\section{Relevant Facts And Assumptions}
\subsection{Relevant Facts}
\begin{itemize}
  \item This project is under irregular time constraints, given that it is 
  for an undergraduate-level software engineering course. 
  \item Digitizing and transcribing polyphonic audio from multiple instruments
   is a difficult task and may be unachievable due to the aforementioned time constraints. 
  \item Many products are currently available as alternatives to what this project hopes 
  to accomplish. The team will use these products and their functionalities as metrics for success.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Business Rules}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Instrument Support
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The application only supports a predefined list of instruments.
    \item No instruments may be added by the user to the predefined list.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Music Theory Compliance
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The application must generate score sheets that adhere to basic music 
    theory rules (e.g., correct note placement, no overlapping notes, etc.).
    \item The application must generate a score sheet within a reasonable amount of time
    to ensure a smooth user experience. 
  \end{itemize}
  \item Ownership
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The application must clearly identify and display the creator/owner of the score.

  \item Should the following assumptions be false, the application will be unusable:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Users of the application have access to the hardware required, such as a music 
    interface or quality microphone.
    \item Users have access to a desktop or portable computer to use the application.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Should the following assumptions be false, the application will perform at sub-optimally: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The operational environment has low levels of background noise.
    \item The human voice is not considered an instrument that the application can handle input from.
    \item Users have a superficial level of understanding of music theory in order to understand 
    what the application does.

\section{The Scope of the Product}
\subsection{Product Boundary}
Input: ScoreGen will be designed to take in and process music data which can be converted to a MIDI or musicXML file representation. The audio should not have excessive noise, or other degradation of quality which could impact the ability to clearly distinguish notes. The input will also be intended to be mono or polyphonic with a singular instrument. The input volume should remain consistent and sufficiently loud, and the user microphone should be correctly calibrated to ensure accuracy by avoiding pitch drift.
\\ \\
Output: The resulting music file will aim to capture the pitch and length of individual notes or chords, but will not capture accents, dynamics, or tempo markings, as well as other advanced elements. If the system detects that a note cannot be reliably transcribed (due to unclear input), it will leave that note blank on the sheet and prompt the user to review the section manually.

\section{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\subsection{Ready-Made Products}
\textbf{Content}: In exploring potential off-the-shelf (OTS) solutions that could fulfill part or all of our project requirements, we have reviewed several existing software products related to music transcription and signal processing. While our primary focus is on learning and building the product from scratch as a capstone project, these products were considered for their applicability and potential use in enhancing our understanding of the field.\\
\textbf{Motivation}: The goal of this investigation was to consider whether any existing solutions could meet our project’s goals or provide insight into how to address specific technical challenges. Given that our focus is on educational value rather than commercial competition, we explored these solutions to learn from their features and limitations.\\

\textbf{Products Investigated}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sibelius}~\cite{sibelius}\\
    \textbf{Description}: Sibelius is a professional music notation software that supports transcription, editing, and playback of sheet music.\\
    \textbf{Applicability}: While Sibelius provides a robust notation environment, it does not directly fulfill the core requirement of real-time audio-to-sheet-music transcription. However, its export capabilities (MusicXML and MIDI) align with our needs for cross-compatibility.\\
    \textbf{Conclusion}: Sibelius is not suitable as a full solution for our project but offers useful insights into notation and export formats.
    
    \item \textbf{AnthemScore}\cite{AnthemScore}\\
    \textbf{Description}: AnthemScore is an automated music transcription software that converts audio recordings into sheet music.\\
    \textbf{Applicability}: AnthemScore is the most closely aligned with our project’s goal of audio-to-sheet-music transcription. It uses machine learning to process audio, which could provide valuable lessons on handling real-time audio input and accuracy.\\
    \textbf{Conclusion}: Although AnthemScore is a ready-made solution for audio transcription, integrating it into our project would limit our learning opportunities. However, understanding its machine learning approach offers valuable technical insights.
    
    \item \textbf{MuseScore}\cite{MuseScore}\\
    \textbf{Description}: MuseScore is an open-source music notation software that supports MusicXML and MIDI input/output.\\
    \textbf{Applicability}: MuseScore offers advanced notation tools and is widely used for music transcription. While it does not handle real-time audio transcription, it could serve as a valuable resource for understanding notation standards and file format handling (MusicXML, MIDI).\\
    \textbf{Conclusion}: MuseScore provides a strong learning resource for notation and file management, but it is not directly applicable for our audio signal processing goals.
    
    \item \textbf{Transcribe!}\cite{Transcribe!}\\
    \textbf{Description}: Transcribe! is a software focused on assisting musicians in transcribing audio files into written music manually.\\
    \textbf{Applicability}: Although Transcribe! focuses more on aiding manual transcription, its use of time-stretching and pitch-shifting techniques for audio processing could offer valuable learning insights for real-time transcription in our project.\\
    \textbf{Conclusion}: Transcribe! is not a direct solution but may offer useful ideas for how to manage and process audio signals for manual transcription.
    
    \item \textbf{Melody Scanner by Klangio}\cite{Melody-Scanner}\\
    \textbf{Description}: Melody Scanner is an online tool that converts audio files, such as recordings of melodies, into sheet music automatically which is the general idea of this project. It focuses on providing a quick and user-friendly way to transcribe melodies for musicians.\\
    \textbf{Applicability}: Melody Scanner aligns closely with our goal of audio-to-sheet-music transcription. However, its focus is primarily on melodic transcription rather than handling complex polyphonic music or real-time input. Despite this, it offers a straightforward user interface and backend processes that could provide useful insights for our project, particularly in terms of simplicity and user experience.\\
    \textbf{Conclusion}: While Melody Scanner is not a comprehensive solution for our capstone project’s real-time transcription needs, it offers valuable lessons in streamlining the user interface and simplifying the transcription process for ease of use.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Description}: PortAudio is a widely used open-source library for handling audio input and output across multiple platforms.\\
\textbf{Rationale for Limited Use}: While audio capture and output are critical components, reinventing this from scratch would require extensive low-level work that would detract from our focus on learning signal processing and transcription. Therefore, we plan to use PortAudio for audio input/output while building the higher-level processing systems ourselves.\\

\subsubsection*{MusicXML Format~\cite{musicxml}}
\textbf{Description}: MusicXML is an open standard for music notation interchange, commonly used in music software.\\
\textbf{Rationale for Limited Use}: Rebuilding a file format from scratch would not significantly contribute to our learning, so we will use MusicXML to ensure compatibility with existing music notation software. However, we will focus our learning efforts on generating and manipulating the MusicXML data from the transcription process.\\

\subsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
Although copying or modifying parts of existing products could save time and effort, our primary goal for this capstone project is to deepen our technical knowledge by solving the challenges ourselves. This section acknowledges the potential solutions but explains why we prefer not to use them, except where strictly necessary. There is one example of an open-source product available to copy from:\\

\subsubsection*{LilyPond (Music Notation Rendering)~\cite{lilypond}}
\textbf{Description}: LilyPond is an open-source music engraving program that renders high-quality sheet music. Its notation rendering capabilities could be adapted for our needs.\\
\textbf{Rationale for Avoiding Copying}: While using LilyPond for notation rendering would simplify output formatting, we aim to build our own system for translating audio to notation and rendering it. This will give us valuable insights into how music notation software operates, which we would miss by relying on LilyPond.\\
\textbf{Approximate Time Savings}: Copying LilyPond’s functionality could reduce our output formatting time by 30–40\%, but we would miss out on understanding the process of rendering notation from scratch.

\section{Migration to the New Product}
\subsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}
Since our sheet music generator app is being developed from scratch and does not replace any existing system, there are no traditional migration requirements from an old system to a new one. However, as users may want to transition from using existing software solutions to our product, the following minimal migration efforts are anticipated:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{File Compatibility}: Users should be able to import existing sheet music files (MusicXML) from other music notation or production software such as Sibelius, Finale, and MuseScore. The app must support these file types and ensure accurate translation into the app’s native system.
    
    \item \textbf{User Familiarization}: Since the app is new, existing users of other music transcription or notation software may need time to familiarize themselves with the workflow and interface. Providing clear tutorials and guidance within the app will be important to ensure a smooth transition for users.
    
    \item \textbf{System Requirements}: The app should clearly communicate its system requirements (e.g., minimum RAM, processor speed) to users transitioning from older or less efficient music notation tools, ensuring their hardware is compatible with the new system.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Data That Has to be Modified or Translated for the New System}
Given that this project is being developed from the ground up, no legacy data exists that needs to be migrated. However, users may bring data from other platforms. The following types of data may need to be translated or modified to work within the new system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{MusicXML and MIDI Files}: The app must allow seamless import of MusicXML files created on other platforms. Any discrepancies or unsupported elements should be flagged, and users should have the ability to adjust elements that do not translate perfectly.
    
    \item \textbf{Audio Files}: Users may import existing audio recordings (WAV, MP3, FLAC) for transcription. The app should accommodate different audio formats and sample rates, translating these into the internal format used for transcription without losing accuracy or quality.
    
    \item \textbf{Notation Adjustments}: Imported sheet music may not always align perfectly with the app’s internal notation system. In such cases, the app should automatically translate formatting elements and provide users with editing tools to make manual adjustments where necessary.
\end{itemize}

\section{Costs}
\textbf{Mid-Range Microphones: \$100 - \$500:} \\
High quality Microphones are essential to capture audio by converting sound waves into electrical signals. If necessary, it may be beneficial for the project to acquire higher quality microphones for testing. \\ \\
\textbf{Storage for Large Data Files:} \\
Cloud or local storage could be an additional potential cost, as features like account management, stored sheet music, or other data could require subscription of a cloud database server (\$100 - \$500 per year), or purchasing more memory (\$50 - \$400).

\section{User Documentation and Training}
\subsection{User Documentation Requirements}
\textbf{Installation and Setup Guide:} \\ This documentation should provide clear instructions for downloading, installing, and configuring the software, including system requirements and initial setup steps to ensure users can easily get the application running on their devices.
\\ 
\textbf{Quick Start Guide:}\\This section should offer a streamlined overview of the essential features and workflow of the application, allowing users to quickly record their first piece of music and generate sheet music with minimal effort.\\
\textbf{Tutorials and Walkthroughs: } \\Developers should document step-by-step guides for various user scenarios, from basic recording to advanced features, ensuring users can understand how to effectively use all functionalities of the application. \\
\textbf{Version History and Updates: }\\ This documentation should detail changes made in each version of the software, including new features, improvements, and bug fixes, helping users stay informed about updates and how they might impact their use of the application. \\
\textbf{Feedback and Support Channels: } \\Clear documentation should outline how users can provide feedback or seek support, including contact information for customer service or a support form, enabling users to get assistance with any issues they encounter. \\
\textbf{Glossary of Terms:}\\ This section should define key technical and musical terminology used throughout the software, helping non-expert users understand the language and concepts related to music transcription and audio processing.
\subsection{Training Requirements}
To ensure sufficient resources for product use, the development team will provide: \\
\textbf{Tutorial Videos:} \\ Develop a series of engaging tutorial videos that visually demonstrate how to use the software, covering basic and advanced features, to cater to various learning styles and help users quickly grasp the application’s functionalities. \\
\textbf{Feedback Mechanism:}\\ Establish a system for collecting user feedback on the training materials and sessions, enabling continuous improvement of the training content and methods based on user experiences and suggestions.


\section{Waiting Room}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The system must support operation on macOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems. Specifically, the supported versions include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item macOS Sonoma 14.0 (or later),
        \item Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (or later),
        \item Windows 11 (or later).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Real-time signal processing should be conducted using Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) as advised by our supervisor. A proof-of-concept must be conducted to evaluate the feasibility of using an RTOS for this purpose.
    \item The system must offer basic MIDI-to-audio conversion for audible feedback, enabling users to determine the correctness of the transcription through a playback feature.
    \item The system must support continuous pitch handling, specifically for instruments and vocals that do not have discrete notes, such as singing and violin performances.
    \item The system should automatically download and install version updates when connected to the internet to ensure the user is always working with the latest software features and bug fixes.
    \item The system must generate optimized guitar tabs that suggest the easiest finger positioning for each note or chord based on the context of the score.
    \item The system must provide a feature to allow users to edit the transcribed sheet music. For example, users should be able to adjust the key signature if they find it incorrect or wish to make changes.
\end{itemize}

\section{Ideas for Solution}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Real time signal processing using C/C++ for speed
  \item Use the libsndfile open source library for signal processing
  \item Deploy as a .exe file
  \item Use some modern framework for front-end development (e.g. React Native, Vue.js)
  \item The user manually identifies the tempo and key to be used in the generated sheet-music
  \item A sheet music editing feature compatible with the musicXML format
\end{itemize}
