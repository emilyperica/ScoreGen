\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
\lips
\subsection{Goals of the Project}
\lips
\section{Stakeholders}
\subsection{Client}
The client is the faculty supervisor of this project, Dr. Martin Von Mohrenschildt. With direct research interests in signal processing and a personal interest in how it relates to 
music, he is investing his own time in the development of the product.
\subsection{Customer}
The archetypal customer is a musician of any skill level, with emphasis based on musicians who have little-to-no music theory knowledge. The customer will utilize the application 
to quickly produce sheet music for either original compositions or existing songs. 
\subsection{Other Stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Software developers:} Provide the technical knowledge and skill to design and build the system.
  \item \textbf{Composers:} As SMEs, provide the music theory knowledge needed to make the system useful for the customer.
  \item \textbf{Users of music-annotating software:} As SMEs, provide opinions on the features they like or dislike about existing music-annotating softwares. This will help inform the developers on which features of the product to prioritize.
  \item \textbf{Music teachers:} Provide similar support to students that may be replaced by usage of this product. They will have a vested interest in ensuring this product does not encourage bad composing habits in users of the product.
  \item \textbf{Music students:} Similar to the Composers, they will provide the music theory knowledge needed to make the system useful for the customer. However, their input will be from the same learning point of view as the expected user, and thus will have a higher degree of influence on the product.
  \item \textbf{IP lawyers:} Will ensure this product follows fair use and does not infringe on copyrights.
  \item \textbf{Dr. Spencer Smith:} As the course instructor, the performance and outcome of this product will be a direct reflection of his role in the capstone course.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Hands-On Users of the Project}
\subsubsection*{User Category 1: Beginner Musicians}
\textbf{User Role:} Use this product to create sheet music, either as a learning aid or as a quick alternative to learning music notation.\\
\textbf{Subject matter experience*:} Novice - Little experience with music theory, but likely have a moderate knowledge of music in practicality (i.e., playing an instrument or listening to music). \\
\textbf{Technological experience*:} Novice - May or may not have limited experience with other music-annotating softwares. \\
\textbf{User characteristics:} 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Little to no music theory knowledge
  \item Passionate about music
  \item All ages (i.e., both children and adults)
  \item New to playing instruments
  \item Not comfortable with complex software
  \item Eager to learn
  \item Less willing to spend money
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{User Category 2: Composers}
\textbf{User Role:} As masters of music notation and composition, this group will use the product as a practice aid or to quickly make note of composition ideas. \\
\textbf{Subject matter experience*:} Master - have spent years learning and practicing music theory and composition. \\
\textbf{Technological experience*:} Journeyman to Master - Have experience with music-annotating software but haven't necessarily used them extensively. \\
\textbf{User characteristics:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Advanced music theory knowledge
  \item Passionate about music
  \item 25+ years old
  \item Have a hard time learning new technologies
  \item Willing to spend money
\end{itemize}
\noindent
\textit{*User experience level may be rated as one of novice, journeyman, or master.}

\subsection{Personas}
Harold Style is a software engineering student at McMaster University with a deep interest in music, and loves playing the guitar. Despite his lack of a formal music education, 
he has perfect pitch and thus learns songs by listening to them rather than learn how to read sheet music. However, he recently joined a local rock band called The Beetles who 
expect him to contribute during their songwriting sessions. He needs a quick way to produce sheet music for his own compositions, as well as learn to read the scores written by 
his bandmates. As a future software engineer he enjoys learning new technologies that can make his life easier, and he dislikes reading of any sort.
\subsection{Priorities Assigned to Users}
\textbf{Key users:} Beginner musicians
\textbf{Secondary users:} Composers.
\subsection{User Participation}
Beginner musicians will have a high level of participation in the creation of system requirements. Their feedback will be especially essential during the early to middle development phases to ensure that the system meets their various needs for simplicity, intuitive design/usage, and music theory assistance.
Composers will have a moderate level of participation in the creation of system requiremens, slightly less than that of the Beginner Musician group. Their subject matter expertise will be useful in creating relevant requirements to ensure precision of audio transcription and its overall score editing capabilities.
\subsection{Maintenance Users and Service Technicians}
This product will be maintained by a software development team, consisting of software developers, UI/UX designers, test engineers, and a project manager. 
Users will receive product support directly from the customer support team, and IP lawyers will be engaged as necessary to address matters of intellectual property.
