\section{Introduction}

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the
hazards.}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? \\
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[\textbullet] \textbf{Jackson:} I think this deliverable was more straightforward than others which allowed us all to have a clear picture of what is expected. As a result, we were able to accomplish the sections we designated as ‘group sections’ very easily as we could have conversations about hazards without any confusion. This was also helped by our group member Emily, who kindly laid out clear definitions of hazards for us to follow.\\
    \end{enumerate}
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?\\
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[\textbullet] \textbf{Jackson:} I think there was one main pain point that stood out in my mind, which was redundancy. This came about because much of what we are discussing in this document was already discussed at length in the form of security and safety requirements, along with use cases and risks. While we were writing some of the sections it felt very redundant to be repeating the points we already made, and in an effort to reduce redundancy, 
        we tried our best to link things back to other sections, which proved to be difficult since the deliverables were so large in scope.\\
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
\end{enumerate}
