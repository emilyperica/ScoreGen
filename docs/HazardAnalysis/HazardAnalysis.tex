\section{Introduction}

Hazards within a software system are not physically dangerous in the same way other engineering systems can be, 
but nonetheless there are still inherent properties of this system that when combined with its environment have 
the potential to cause harm. In the case of ScoreGen, a hazard is any situation or condition that may produce an 
undesirable outcome for any of the system’s stakeholders. The hazardous outcomes of this system are not likely to 
cause physical harm, but may instead provide harm to a user’s mental wellbeing, reputation, and other intangible 
ill-effects. There is a possibility of physical hazards that arise from interfacing with external systems, which 
may cause bodily harm in addition to the non-physical effects.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

Hazards within the system have potential to incur losses on behalf of the developers, users, and other stakeholders. 
Performing a hazard analysis on the ScoreGen system can reduce the scope of potential losses and ensure the correct 
mitigation strategies are in place. Risks and liabilities of the system are likely to reduce user satisfaction with 
the system, pushing them away from our product and losing their trust. Accumulation of such occurrences will damage 
the system developers’ reputation, making it difficult to compete with other software systems that provide similar 
functionalities. \\

\noindent
This hazard analysis will focus on potential hazards arising from the software system being designed (ScoreGen), but 
hazard scope is extended to include various external interfacing systems as well. These systems include an Audio 
Interfacer (a device needed to process continuous signals from a cable audio input), the user’s instrument of choice, 
and the device being used to run the application.


\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? \\
    \textbf{Mark} \\
    \textbf{Ian} \\
    \textbf{Emily} Writing the introduction section for this deliverable helped me to gain 
    an understanding of how we can mitigate risks and avoid hazards in our project, despite 
    our system not containing many hazards in the traditional sense. When I think ‘hazard 
    analysis’ my mind goes to things like WHMIS and high voltage training - even the lab 
    trainings I’ve done for software courses have only ever focused on physical hazards. 
    That being said, there are certainly still other ways for a person to incur loss, and 
    putting this deliverable together painted a better picture in my mind of how we can do 
    our best to mitigate risks throughout our capstone project. \\
    \textbf{Jackson} \\
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them? \\
    \textbf{Mark} \\
    \textbf{Ian} \\
    \textbf{Emily} The part of this deliverable that I thought went well was simultaneously 
    the largest pain point - brainstorming the possible non-physical hazards for ScoreGen. 
    The process overall helped me to expand my understanding of a hazard, but it took a lot 
    of back and forth for us to settle on and come up with a viable set of potential hazards. 
    This is the kind of pain point that can’t really be resolved, but just has to be worked 
    through instead. Talking aloud and throwing ideas at one another helped to ease the 
    brainstorming process and finalize the FMEA. \\
    \textbf{Jackson} \\
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
