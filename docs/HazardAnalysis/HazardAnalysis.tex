\section{Introduction}

Hazards within a software system are not physically dangerous in the same way other engineering systems can be, 
but nonetheless there are still inherent properties of this system that when combined with its environment have 
the potential to cause harm. In the case of ScoreGen, a hazard is any situation or condition that may produce an 
undesirable outcome for any of the system’s stakeholders. The hazardous outcomes of this system are not likely to 
cause physical harm, but may instead provide harm to a user’s mental wellbeing, reputation, and other intangible 
ill-effects. There is a possibility of physical hazards that arise from interfacing with external systems, which 
may cause bodily harm in addition to the non-physical effects.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

Hazards within the system have potential to incur losses on behalf of the developers, users, and other stakeholders. 
Performing a hazard analysis on the ScoreGen system can reduce the scope of potential losses and ensure the correct 
mitigation strategies are in place. Risks and liabilities of the system are likely to reduce user satisfaction with 
the system, pushing them away from our product and losing their trust. Accumulation of such occurrences will damage 
the system developers’ reputation, making it difficult to compete with other software systems that provide similar 
functionalities. \\

\noindent
This hazard analysis will focus on potential hazards arising from the software system being designed (ScoreGen), but 
hazard scope is extended to include various external interfacing systems as well. These systems include an Audio 
Interfacer (a device needed to process continuous signals from a cable audio input), the user’s instrument of choice, 
and the device being used to run the application.


\section{System Boundaries and Components}
Outlined below are the key components that define the system and its interactions. These include both software and hardware elements.  
\subsection{The Application}
\subsubsection{User Interface (UI)}
A graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the users to interact with the application. The user will use the GUI to upload audio files, 
export files, and view system feedback.

\subsubsection{Back-end Software}
The core of the application that processes user input, it can be further broken down into the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Raw audio data processing:} Read in audio signals and convert to symbolic music notation (e.g., .WAV to MIDI).
    \item \textbf{Transcription:} Convert the processed data to music layout formats for rendering into sheet music.
    \item \textbf{File management:} Export symbolic music data or rendered sheet music (MIDI, musicXML, PDF).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Device}
The device that the user will install and run the application on. The device provides the existing hardware and software that the 
application will interact with, such as the operating system (OS) and relevant system libraries that perform I/O operations (e.g., 
file management, audio device access, etc.).

\subsection{User External Input Devices}
Other devices or hardware the user may have, such as microphones, audio interfaces, or instruments.

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

Currently, there are no new safety or security requirements, but any new requirements will be added to this document as part of our iterative development process. Newly discovered requirements will also be evaluated and incorporated into the SRS to ensure alignment with evolving project needs and insights gained during development.


\section{Roadmap}

We will likely fulfill every one of the security and safety-critical requirements within the timeline of the capstone course, and we will be loosely following the compliance of the requirements based on the priority assigned below:

\subsection{Safety-Critical Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{PR-SC1 Epilepsy Safety}: \textit{High priority}, as it ensures the app’s visual safety for users from the start. Compliance with WCAG 2.1 should be confirmed early on to prevent any risks during development.
    \item \textbf{PR-SC2 Instrument Input Setup}: \textit{High priority} for both user safety and accurate functionality, ensuring users can set up their instruments without misconfiguration. This interactive guide can be iteratively refined through user testing early in development.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Privacy Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{S-P2 PII}: \textit{High priority}, as ensuring the app does not collect any Personal Identifiable Information aligns with the app’s privacy-first design. This requirement should be validated as soon as any data processing is introduced.
    \item \textbf{S-P3 Input Data}: \textit{Low priority}, focusing on ensuring that temporary files are properly cleared after processing is complete. Implementing this is less critical since we will not be storing any data outside of the user’s system.
    \item \textbf{S-P1 Data Storage}: \textit{Medium priority}, ensuring that user-generated data is stored in local, user-chosen locations. This feature should be verified once output functions are introduced.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Access Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{S-A1 User Authentication}: \textit{High priority}, by removing the need for login functionalities, we will speed up initial development. It should be verified after the core interface is complete.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Audit and Immunity Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Audit Requirements (N/A)}: \textit{Low priority}, as the system is offline and does not require developer responsibility over user data.
    \item \textbf{Immunity Requirements (N/A)}: \textit{Low priority}, as no data storage minimizes exposure to security risks.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? \\
    \textbf{Mark} \\
    \textbf{Ian} \\
    \textbf{Emily} Writing the introduction section for this deliverable helped me to gain 
    an understanding of how we can mitigate risks and avoid hazards in our project, despite 
    our system not containing many hazards in the traditional sense. When I think ‘hazard 
    analysis’ my mind goes to things like WHMIS and high voltage training - even the lab 
    trainings I’ve done for software courses have only ever focused on physical hazards. 
    That being said, there are certainly still other ways for a person to incur loss, and 
    putting this deliverable together painted a better picture in my mind of how we can do 
    our best to mitigate risks throughout our capstone project. \\
    \textbf{Jackson} \\
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them? \\
    \textbf{Mark} \\
    \textbf{Ian} \\
    \textbf{Emily} The part of this deliverable that I thought went well was simultaneously 
    the largest pain point - brainstorming the possible non-physical hazards for ScoreGen. 
    The process overall helped me to expand my understanding of a hazard, but it took a lot 
    of back and forth for us to settle on and come up with a viable set of potential hazards. 
    This is the kind of pain point that can’t really be resolved, but just has to be worked 
    through instead. Talking aloud and throwing ideas at one another helped to ease the 
    brainstorming process and finalize the FMEA. \\
    \textbf{Jackson} \\
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
\end{enumerate}
