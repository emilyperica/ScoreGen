## Development

1. Install the [vcpkg](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/overview) package manager.
2. Run and build using CMake - if using the build scripts, note that ```cleanBuild.sh``` will entirely remove and rebuild dependencies from source which is usually only necessary if you've edited ```CMakeLists.txt```.
